<h3>Tic Tac Toe is a classic and simple game played on a 3x3 grid. Here's a description of how it works: </h3>
<h1>Objective: </h1>
<h3>The goal is to be the first player to align three of their symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the grid.</h3>
<h2>Setup: </h2>
<h3>1. Grid: A 3x3 grid is used, which creates 9 empty squares.</h3>
<h3>2. Players: There are two players. One uses X and the other uses O.</h3>
<h2>Rules: </h2>
<h3>1. Turns: Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in one of the empty squares.</h3>
<h3>2. Winning: A player wins by placing three of their symbols in a row, which can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</h3>
<h3>3. Draw: If all 9 squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.</h3>
<h2>Example Playthrough: </h2>
<h3>1. Player X places an X in the top-left corner.</h3>
<h3>2. Player O places an O in the center.</h3>
<h3>3. Player X places another X in the top-center square.</h3>
<h3>4. Player O places an O in the bottom-right corner.</h3>
<h3>5. Player X places an X in the top-right corner, winning with three Xâ€™s in the top row.</h3>
<h2>Strategy: </h2>
<h3>1. Blocking: Prevent your opponent from aligning three of their symbols.</h3>
<h3>2. Corners and Center: Often, the best strategy involves taking the center or corner positions, which provide more opportunities to win.</h3>

<h2>End of Game: </h2>
<h3>The game ends when a player aligns three symbols or when all squares are filled without any player winning, resulting in a draw. </h3>
